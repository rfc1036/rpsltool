The following perl modules are needed:

YAML::XS			# libyaml-libyaml-perl
Cache::FileCache		# libcache-cache-perl
Net::IP::XS			# libnet-ip-xs-perl
Template			# libtemplate-perl
Moo				# libmoo-perl
Type::Tiny			# libtype-tiny-perl
IPC::System::Simple		# libipc-system-simple-perl
namespace::clean		# libnamespace-clean-perl

The following other dependencies are needed:
https://github.com/bgp/bgpq4	# bgpq4

To install the package, unpack it in /usr/local/lib/, /opt/ or another
appropriate directory and then create symlinks to the programs from a
directory in the $PATH.

Even if the code mentions bgpq3, I have switched to bgpq4 long ago and
strongly recommend it.
The Net::Whois::RIPE backend has been deprecated for a long time and is
being removed.

The point of the supplied template files is not to provide fully
generic and parametrized templates which can be used for every
router in every company, but to show some examples of template which
after some customization may be used for a class of routers in a company.

The mambo and hula example configuration files are a subset of real
configuration files which are being used in production.
