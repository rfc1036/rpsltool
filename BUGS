If the expansion of the arguments of an import attribute is empty then
everything is accepted.
The MINAP BIRD template instead rejects everything, but the program
should still be improved to handle the case of peers filtered only by
as-path (even if this is not relevant for an IXP route server).

If the whois server closes the connection without reporting an error
Net::Whois::RIPE will not notice it and will return success.

More documentation is needed.

asn32_supported only works for import().
